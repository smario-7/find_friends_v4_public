## Find Friends v4

The application searches for a group of people with similar characteristics provided by the user. The database is built based on a survey conducted among GOTOIT course participants.

The search is performed in two ways:
* by selecting one's characteristics in checkboxes
* based on a self-description and semantic selection of characteristics from the database

The application assigns a group of people with the most similar characteristics:
* age group
* education
* favorite animals
* favorite place on Earth
* gender

The application tests the capabilities of the Qdrant database and vector search of records by embeddings, as well as ML classification for training a pipeline.
